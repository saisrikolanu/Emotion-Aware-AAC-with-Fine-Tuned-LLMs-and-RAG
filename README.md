## üìñ Overview
This project enhances **Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)** systems for individuals with speech impairments by integrating **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
The system generates **empathetic, expressive, and personalized responses**, addressing limitations of templated AAC systems.

## üìä Datasets
- **EmpatheticDialogues** ‚Äì ~25k conversations grounded in emotional situations (32 emotions).  
- **GoEmotions** ‚Äì 58k+ Reddit comments annotated with 27 fine-grained emotions + neutral.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Fine-Tuned LLM**
   - Base model: **T5-Small (Hugging Face)**
   - Fine-tuned with **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** on hybrid emotional datasets.
   - Incorporates emotion tokens `[emotion]` for contextual response generation.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - FAISS + `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings.
   - Retrieves user-specific narratives to ground responses.
   - Reduces hallucinations and improves personalization.

3. **Interactive Streamlit Interface**
   - Emotion detection from user input.  
   - Style Controls: **formality, tone, response length, personality traits, greeting prefix**.  
   - Multiple generated responses with user selection.  
   - Simulates real AAC usage.
